# Deploy TensorFlow Serving container in Azure

Once we have Docker image ready and published to docker repository, we can create a docker cluster in Azure managed using Kubernetes and have the container running in a *high availability* fashion. You can use any other cloud service but you need to use your own deployment procedure for Google or AWS for example but the concept will be still the same. We have an image with needed S/W plus data and we need to run it in a publicly accessible Docker cluster.

First we will need to create a resource group to host this cluster. We will need to run the below in Azure CLI locally or the one provided in the portal.

```
az group create --name InceptionServing --location australiaeast
```

Next, we will need to create Kubernetes cluster, connect to it and verify it is up and running. This can take a bit of time so be patient. 

```
az acs create --orchestrator-type kubernetes --resource-group InceptionServing --name InceptionServingK8sCluster --generate-ssh-keys

az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=InceptionServing --name=InceptionServingK8sCluster

kubectl get nodes
```

The last command will show all the nodes in the cluster.

Next, we will download Kubernetes configuration file and create a new service based on this file. 
The two important lines in this file are:
* Defining which image to pull and create containers
```
image: ylashin/tensorflow-serving
```
* Startup shell command to excute once each container is instantiated
 ```
  args :
    - tensorflow_model_server --port=7000 --model_name=dogs-vs-cats --model_base_path=/export/dogs-vs-cats
```

Please note that you may need to update this file in case you have your own docker image as it will have a different name. If this is the case, you will need to update the line starting with `image:` with your own value.


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ylashin/deep-learning-end-to-end/master/Kubernetes/inception_k8s.yaml

kubectl create -f inception_k8s.yaml

kubectl get service inception-service --watch
```


Initially the EXTERNAL-IP for the `inception-service` service appears as pending. Once the EXTERNAL-IP address has changed from pending to an IP address, use CTRL-C to stop the kubectl watch process.

```
yousry@Azure:~$ kubectl get service inception-service --watch
NAME                CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
inception-service   10.0.54.7    <pending>     7000:30441/TCP   47s
inception-service   10.0.54.7   13.75.130.1   7000:30441/TCP   3m
```

You can take the external IP and try to Telnet it on port 7000 and if it replies then probably we should be fine. For sure, the above external IP is something related to the cluster I have created and is probably not valid at the time you are reading this tutorial.


```
telnet 13.75.130.1 7000
```

Next step is to deploy the front end web application used to upload images and get predictions.

## Reminder
Once you are done playing with this tutorial, you better turn off/delete all cloud resources or artifcats created otherwise your Azure/AWS/Google balance will be drained.

```
az group delete --name InceptionServing --yes --no-wait
```
