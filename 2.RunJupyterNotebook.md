# Progressively run Jupyter notebooks to come up with final model


There is not much to mention in this page. You will need to open the notebooks we have downloaded in the previous step one after the other and they are numbered in intended order.
In each notebook, run the cells from start to end. They should be self explanatory as they have code and documentation together.

The notebooks are mainly about progressing from a plain neural network in Keras to a decent quality convolution neural network that can differentiate dogs from cats. The final outcome from the last notebook should be a serialised copy of that network that can be used in TensorFlow Serving.


TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments.
Meaning, we can load the final network(model) we have in Serving and then issue prediction calls and get results.
These prediction calls have to use a protocl called gRPC but there are nuget packages/tools to consume it using C# similar to old WSDL & WCF tools that convert contracts into client proxies.

Anyway more on that later but for now we can proceed with next step [Create a docker image to serve trained model using TensorFlow Serving](3.CreateServingDockerImage.md).
